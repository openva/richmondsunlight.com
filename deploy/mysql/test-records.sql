Determination of \r  gestational age shall be based upon measurement of the fetus in a manner \r  consistent with standard medical practice in the community for determining \r  gestational age. When only the gestational sac is visible during ultrasound \r  imaging, gestational age may be based upon measurement of the gestational sac. \r  If gestational age cannot be determined by a transabdominal ultrasound, then \r  the patient undergoing the abortion shall be verbally offered other ultrasound \r  imaging to determine gestational age, which she may refuse. A print of the \r  ultrasound image shall be made to document the measurements that have been \r  taken to determine the gestational age of the fetus.</s></p>\r  \r   <p><s>The provisions of this subsection \r  shall not apply if the woman seeking an abortion is the victim of rape or \r  incest, if the incident was reported to law-enforcement authorities. Nothing \r  herein shall preclude the physician from using any ultrasound imaging that he \r  considers to be medically appropriate pursuant to the standard medical practice \r  in the community.</s></p>\r  \r   <p><s>C. The qualified medical \r  professional performing fetal ultrasound imaging pursuant to subsection B shall \r  verbally offer the woman an opportunity to view the ultrasound image, receive a \r  printed copy of the ultrasound image and hear the fetal heart tones pursuant to \r  standard medical practice in the community, and shall obtain from the woman \r  written certification that this opportunity was offered and whether or not it \r  was accepted and, if applicable, verification that the pregnant woman lives at \r  least 100 miles from the facility where the abortion is to be performed. A \r  printed copy of the ultrasound image shall be maintained in the woman\'s medical \r  record at the facility where the abortion is to be performed for the longer of \r  (i) seven years or (ii) the extent required by applicable federal or state law.</s></p>\r  \r   <p><s>D. For purposes of this \r  section:</s></p>\r  \r   <p><s>\"Informed written \r  consent\" means the knowing and voluntary written consent to abortion by a \r  pregnant woman of any age, without undue inducement or any element of force, \r  fraud, deceit, duress, or other form of constraint or coercion by the physician \r  who is to perform the abortion or his agent. The basic information to effect \r  such consent, as required by this subsection, shall be provided by telephone or \r  in person to the woman at least 24 hours before the abortion by the physician \r  who is to perform the abortion, by a referring physician, or by a licensed \r  professional or practical nurse working under the direct supervision of either \r  the physician who is to perform the abortion or the referring physician; \r  however, the information in subdivision 5 may be provided instead by a licensed \r  health-care professional working under the direct supervision of either the \r  physician who is to perform the abortion or the referring physician.

An offer to review \r  the printed materials described in subsection F.

Such regulations:</p>\r  \r   <p>1. Shall include minimum standards for (i) the construction \r  and maintenance of hospitals, nursing homes and certified nursing facilities to \r  ensure the environmental protection and the life safety of its patients, employees, and the public; \r  (ii) the operation, staffing and equipping of hospitals, nursing homes and \r  certified nursing facilities; (iii) qualifications and training of staff of \r  hospitals, nursing homes and certified nursing facilities, except those \r  professionals licensed or certified by the Department of Health Professions; \r  (iv) conditions under which a hospital or nursing home may provide medical and \r  nursing services to patients in their places of residence; and (v) policies \r  related to infection prevention, disaster preparedness, and facility security \r  of hospitals, nursing homes, and certified nursing facilities.<s> For purposes of this paragraph, facilities in \r  which five or more first trimester abortions per month are performed shall be \r  classified as a category of \"hospital\"</s>;</p>\r  \r   <p>2. Shall provide that at least one physician who is licensed \r  to practice medicine in this Commonwealth shall be on call at all times, though \r  not necessarily physically present on the premises, at each hospital which \r  operates or holds itself out as operating an emergency service;</p>\r  \r   <p>3. May classify hospitals and nursing homes by type of \r  specialty or service and may provide for licensing hospitals and nursing homes \r  by bed capacity and by type of specialty or service;</p>\r  \r   <p>4. Shall also require that each hospital establish a protocol \r  for organ donation, in compliance with federal law and the regulations of the \r  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), particularly 42 C.F.R. § \r  482.45. Each hospital shall have an agreement with an organ procurement \r  organization designated in CMS regulations for routine contact, whereby the \r  provider\'s designated organ procurement organization certified by CMS (i) is \r  notified in a timely manner of all deaths or imminent deaths of patients in the \r  hospital and (ii) is authorized to determine the suitability of the decedent or \r  patient for organ donation and, in the absence of a similar arrangement with \r  any eye bank or tissue bank in Virginia certified by the Eye Bank Association \r  of America or the American Association of Tissue Banks, the suitability for \r  tissue and eye donation. The hospital shall also have an agreement with at \r  least one tissue bank and at least one eye bank to cooperate in the retrieval, \r  processing, preservation, storage, and distribution of tissues and eyes to \r  ensure that all usable tissues and eyes are obtained from potential donors and \r  to avoid interference with organ procurement.

The intake officer \r  or clerk with whom the petition or motion is filed shall inquire whether the \r  petitioner is receiving child support services or public assistance. No \r  individual who is receiving support services or public assistance shall be \r  denied the right to file a petition or motion to establish, modify, or enforce \r  an order for support of a child.

The appearance of a child before an intake officer may be \r  by (i) personal appearance before the intake officer or (ii) use of two-way \r  electronic video and audio communication. If two-way electronic video and audio \r  communication is used, an intake officer may exercise all powers conferred by \r  law. All communications and proceedings shall be conducted in the same manner \r  as if the appearance were in person, and any documents filed may be transmitted \r  by facsimile process. The facsimile may be served or executed by the officer or \r  person to whom sent, and returned in the same manner, and with the same force, \r  effect, authority, and liability as an original document. All signatures \r  thereon shall be treated as original signatures.

A petition alleging that a juvenile \r  committed a violent juvenile felony shall be filed with the court. A petition \r  alleging that a juvenile is delinquent for an offense that would be a felony if \r  committed by an adult shall be filed with the court if the juvenile had \r  previously been proceeded against informally by intake or had been adjudicated \r  delinquent for an offense that would be a felony if committed by an adult.</p>\r  \r   <p>If a juvenile is alleged to be a truant pursuant to a complaint \r  filed in accordance with § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/22.1-258\">22.1-258</a> and the attendance officer has provided \r  documentation to the intake officer that the relevant school division has \r  complied with the provisions of § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/22.1-258\">22.1-258</a>, then the intake officer shall file \r  a petition with the court. The intake officer may defer filing the complaint \r  for 90 days and proceed informally by developing a truancy plan, provided that<s> (a)</s><ins> (1)</ins> \r  the juvenile has not previously been proceeded against informally or \r  adjudicated in need of supervision on more than two occasions for failure to \r  comply with compulsory school attendance as provided in § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/22.1-254\">22.1-254</a> and<s> (b)</s><ins> (2)</ins> \r  the immediately previous informal action or adjudication occurred at least \r  three calendar years prior to the current complaint. The juvenile and his \r  parent or parents, guardian, or other person standing in loco parentis must \r  agree, in writing, for the development of a truancy plan. The truancy plan may \r  include requirements that the juvenile and his parent or parents, guardian, or \r  other person standing in loco parentis participate in such programs, cooperate \r  in such treatment, or be subject to such conditions and limitations as \r  necessary to ensure the juvenile\'s compliance with compulsory school attendance \r  as provided in § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/22.1-254\">22.1-254</a>. The intake officer may refer the juvenile to the \r  appropriate public agency for the purpose of developing a truancy plan using an \r  interagency interdisciplinary team approach. The team may include qualified \r  personnel who are reasonably available from the appropriate department of \r  social services, community services board, local school division, court service \r  unit, and other appropriate and available public and private agencies and may \r  be the family assessment and planning team established pursuant to § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/2.2-5207\">2.2-5207</a>. \r  If at the end of the 90-day period the juvenile has not successfully completed \r  the truancy plan or the truancy program, then the intake officer shall file the \r  petition.</p>\r  \r   <p>Whenever informal action is taken as provided in this \r  subsection on a complaint alleging that a child is in need of services, in need \r  of supervision, or delinquent, the intake officer shall<s> (1)</s><ins> (A)</ins> develop a plan for the \r  juvenile, which may include restitution and the performance of community \r  service, based upon community resources and the circumstances which resulted in \r  the complaint,<s> (2)</s><ins> (B)</ins> \r  create an official record of the action taken by the intake officer and file \r  such record in the juvenile\'s case file, and<s> (3)</s><ins> (C)</ins> advise the juvenile and \r  the juvenile\'s parent, guardian, or other person standing in loco parentis and \r  the complainant that any subsequent complaint alleging that the child is in \r  need of supervision or delinquent based upon facts which may be sufficient to \r  invoke the jurisdiction of the court pursuant to § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-241\">16.1-241</a> will result in the \r  filing of a petition with the court.</p>\r  \r   <p>C. The intake officer shall accept and file a petition in \r  which it is alleged that (i) the custody, visitation, or support of a child is the \r  subject of controversy or requires determination, (ii) a person has deserted, \r  abandoned, or failed to provide support for any person in violation of law, \r  (iii) a child or such child\'s parent, guardian, legal custodian, or other \r  person standing in loco parentis is entitled to treatment, rehabilitation, or \r  other services which are required by law, (iv) family abuse has occurred and a \r  protective order is being sought pursuant to § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-253.1\">16.1-253.1</a>, <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-253.4\">16.1-253.4</a>, or \r  <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-279.1\">16.1-279.1</a>, or (v) an act of violence, force, or threat has occurred, a \r  protective order is being sought pursuant to § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-152.8\">19.2-152.8</a>, <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-152.9\">19.2-152.9</a>, or \r  <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-152.10\">19.2-152.10</a>, and either the alleged victim or the respondent is a juvenile. If \r  any such complainant does not file a petition, the intake officer may file it. \r  In cases in which a child is alleged to be abused, neglected, in need of \r  services, in need of supervision, or delinquent, if the intake officer believes \r  that probable cause does not exist, or that the authorization of a petition \r  will not be in the best interest of the family or juvenile or that the matter \r  may be effectively dealt with by some agency other than the court, he may \r  refuse to authorize the filing of a petition. The intake officer shall provide \r  to a person seeking a protective order pursuant to § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-253.1\">16.1-253.1</a>, <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-253.4\">16.1-253.4</a>, or \r  <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-279.1\">16.1-279.1</a> a written explanation of the conditions, procedures and time limits \r  applicable to the issuance of protective orders pursuant to § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-253.1\">16.1-253.1</a>, \r  <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-253.4\">16.1-253.4</a>, or <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-279.1\">16.1-279.1</a>. If the person is seeking a protective order pursuant \r  to § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-152.8\">19.2-152.8</a>, <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-152.9\">19.2-152.9</a>, or <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-152.10\">19.2-152.10</a>, the intake officer shall provide a \r  written explanation of the conditions, procedures, and time limits applicable \r  to the issuance of protective orders pursuant to § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-152.8\">19.2-152.8</a>, <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-152.9\">19.2-152.9</a>, or \r  <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-152.10\">19.2-152.10</a>.</p>\r  \r   <p>D. Prior to the filing of any petition alleging that a child \r  is in need of supervision, the matter shall be reviewed by an intake officer \r  who shall determine whether the petitioner and the child alleged to be in need \r  of supervision have utilized or attempted to utilize treatment and services \r  available in the community and have exhausted all appropriate nonjudicial \r  remedies which are available to them. When the intake officer determines that \r  the parties have not attempted to utilize available treatment or services or \r  have not exhausted all appropriate nonjudicial remedies which are available, he \r  shall refer the petitioner and the child alleged to be in need of supervision \r  to the appropriate agency, treatment facility, or individual to receive \r  treatment or services, and a petition shall not be filed. Only after the intake \r  officer determines that the parties have made a reasonable effort to utilize \r  available community treatment or services may he permit the petition to be \r  filed.</p>\r  \r   <p>E. If the intake officer refuses to authorize a petition \r  relating to an offense that if committed by an adult would be punishable as a \r  Class 1 misdemeanor or as a felony, the complainant shall be notified in \r  writing at that time of the complainant\'s right to apply to a magistrate for a \r  warrant. If a magistrate determines that probable cause exists, he shall issue \r  a warrant returnable to the juvenile and domestic relations district court. The \r  warrant shall be delivered forthwith to the juvenile court, and the intake \r  officer shall accept and file a petition founded upon the warrant. If the court \r  is closed and the magistrate finds that the criteria for detention or shelter \r  care set forth in § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-248.1\">16.1-248.1</a> have been satisfied, the juvenile may be \r  detained pursuant to the warrant issued in accordance with this subsection. If \r  the intake officer refuses to authorize a petition relating to a child in need \r  of services or in need of supervision, a status offense, or a misdemeanor other \r  than Class 1, his decision is final.</p>\r  \r   <p>Upon delivery to the juvenile court of a warrant issued \r  pursuant to subdivision 2 of § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-256\">16.1-256</a>, the intake officer shall accept and \r  file a petition founded upon the warrant.</p>\r  \r   <p>F.

Seizure and impoundment of animals; notice and \r  hearing; disposition of animal; disposition of proceeds upon sale.</p>\r  \r   <p>A. Any humane investigator, law-enforcement officer or animal \r  control officer may lawfully seize and impound any animal that has been \r  abandoned, has been cruelly treated, or is suffering from an apparent violation \r  of this chapter that has rendered the animal in such a condition as to \r  constitute a direct and immediate threat to its life, safety or health. The \r  seizure or impoundment of an equine resulting from a violation of clause<s> (iii)</s><ins> (iv)</ins> \r  of subsection A or clause (ii) of subsection B of § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/3.2-6570\">3.2-6570</a> may be undertaken \r  only by the State Veterinarian or State Veterinarian\'s representative who has \r  received training in the examination and detection of sore horses as required \r  by 9 C.F.R. Part 11.7.</p>\r  \r   <p>B. Before seizing or impounding any agricultural animal, the \r  humane investigator, law-enforcement officer or animal control officer shall \r  contact the State Veterinarian or State Veterinarian\'s representative, who \r  shall recommend to the person the most appropriate action for effecting the seizure \r  and impoundment. The humane investigator, law-enforcement officer or animal \r  control officer shall notify the owner of the agricultural animal and the local \r  attorney for the Commonwealth of the recommendation. The humane investigator, \r  law-enforcement officer or animal control officer may impound the agricultural \r  animal on the land where the agricultural animal is located if:</p>\r  \r   <p>1. The owner or tenant of the land where the agricultural \r  animal is located gives written permission;</p>\r  \r   <p>2. A general district court so orders; or</p>\r  \r   <p>3. The owner or tenant of the land where the agricultural \r  animal is located cannot be immediately located, and it is in the best interest \r  of the agricultural animal to be impounded on the land where it is located \r  until the written permission of the owner or tenant of the land can be \r  obtained.</p>\r  \r   <p>If there is a direct and immediate threat to an agricultural \r  animal, the humane investigator, law-enforcement officer or animal control \r  officer may seize the animal, in which case the humane investigator, \r  law-enforcement officer or animal control officer shall file within five \r  business days on a form approved by the State Veterinarian a report on the \r  condition of the animal at the time of the seizure, the location of \r  impoundment, and any other information required by the State Veterinarian.</p>\r  \r   <p>C. Upon seizing or impounding an animal, the humane \r  investigator, law-enforcement officer or animal control officer shall petition \r  the general district court in the city or county where the animal is seized for \r  a hearing. The hearing shall be not more than 10 business days from the date of \r  the seizure of the animal. The hearing shall be to determine whether the animal \r  has been abandoned, has been cruelly treated, or has not been provided adequate \r  care.</p>\r  \r   <p>D. The humane investigator, law-enforcement officer, or animal \r  control officer shall cause to be served upon the person with a right of \r  property in the animal or the custodian of the animal notice of the hearing. If \r  such person or the custodian is known and residing within the jurisdiction \r  wherein the animal is seized, written notice shall be given at least five days \r  prior to the hearing of the time and place of the hearing. If such person or \r  the custodian is known but residing out of the jurisdiction where such animal \r  is seized, written notice by any method or service of process as is provided by \r  the Code of Virginia shall be given. If such person or the custodian is not \r  known, the humane investigator, law-enforcement officer, or animal control \r  officer shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in \r  the jurisdiction wherein such animal is seized notice of the hearing at least \r  one time prior to the hearing and shall further cause notice of the hearing to \r  be posted at least five days prior to the hearing at the place provided for \r  public notices at the city hall or courthouse wherein such hearing shall be \r  held.</p>\r  \r   <p>E. The procedure for appeal and trial shall be the same as \r  provided by law for misdemeanors. Trial by jury shall be as provided in Article \r  4 (§ <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-260\">19.2-260</a> et seq.) of Chapter 15 of Title 19.2. The Commonwealth shall be \r  required to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\r  \r   <p>F. The humane investigator, law-enforcement officer, or animal \r  control officer shall provide for such animal until the court has concluded the \r  hearing. Any locality may require the owner of any animal held pursuant to this \r  subsection for more than<s> thirty</s><ins> 30</ins> days to post a bond in \r  surety with the locality for the amount of the cost of boarding the animal for \r  a period of time set by ordinance, not to exceed nine months.</p>\r  \r   <p>In any locality that has not adopted such an ordinance, a \r  court may order the owner of an animal held pursuant to this subsection for \r  more than 30 days to post a bond in surety with the locality for the amount of \r  the cost of boarding the animal for a period of time not to exceed nine months. \r  The bond shall not be forfeited if the owner is found to be not guilty of the \r  violation.</p>\r  \r   <p>If the court determines that the animal has been neither \r  abandoned, cruelly treated, nor deprived of adequate care, the animal shall be \r  returned to the owner. If the court determines that the animal has been (i) \r  abandoned or cruelly treated, (ii) deprived of adequate care, as that term is \r  defined in § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/3.2-6500\">3.2-6500</a>, or (iii) raised as a dog that has been, is, or is \r  intended to be used in dogfighting in violation of § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/3.2-6571\">3.2-6571</a>, then the court \r  shall order that the animal may be: (a) sold by a local governing body, if not \r  a companion animal; (b) disposed of by a local governing body pursuant to \r  subsection D of § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/3.2-6546\">3.2-6546</a>, whether such animal is a companion animal or an \r  agricultural animal; or (c) delivered to the person with a right of property in \r  the animal as provided in subsection G.</p>\r  \r   <p>G. In no case shall the owner be allowed to purchase, adopt, \r  or otherwise obtain the animal if the court determines that the animal has been \r  abandoned, cruelly treated, or deprived of adequate care. The court shall \r  direct that the animal be delivered to the person with a right of property in \r  the animal, upon his request, if the court finds that the abandonment, cruel \r  treatment, or deprivation of adequate care is not attributable to the actions \r  or inactions of such person.</p>\r  \r   <p>H. The court shall order the owner of any animal determined to \r  have been abandoned, cruelly treated, or deprived of adequate care to pay all \r  reasonable expenses incurred in caring and providing for such animal from the \r  time the animal is seized until such time that the animal is disposed of in \r  accordance with the provisions of this section, to the provider of such care.</p>\r  \r   <p>I. The court may prohibit the possession or ownership of other \r  companion animals by the owner of any companion animal found to have been \r  abandoned, cruelly treated, or deprived of adequate care. In making a \r  determination to prohibit the possession or ownership of companion animals, the \r  court may take into consideration the owner\'s past record of convictions under \r  this chapter or other laws prohibiting cruelty to animals or pertaining to the \r  care or treatment of animals and the owner\'s mental and physical condition.</p>\r  \r   <p>J. If the court finds that an agricultural animal has been \r  abandoned or cruelly treated, the court may prohibit the possession or \r  ownership of any other agricultural animal by the owner of the agricultural \r  animal if the owner has exhibited a pattern of abandoning or cruelly treating \r  agricultural animals as evidenced by previous convictions of violating § \r  <a href=\"https://vacode.org/3.2-6504\">3.2-6504</a> or <a href=\"https://vacode.org/3.2-6570\">3.2-6570</a>. In making a determination to prohibit the possession or \r  ownership of agricultural animals, the court may take into consideration the \r  owner\'s mental and physical condition.</p>\r  \r   <p>K. Any person who is prohibited from owning or possessing \r  animals pursuant to subsection I or J may petition the court to repeal the \r  prohibition after two years have elapsed from the date of entry of the court\'s \r  order. The court may, in its discretion, repeal the prohibition if the person \r  can prove to the satisfaction of the court that the cause for the prohibition \r  has ceased to exist.</p>\r  \r   <p>L. When a sale occurs, the proceeds shall first be applied to \r  the costs of the sale then next to the unreimbursed expenses for the care and \r  provision of the animal, and the remaining proceeds, if any, shall be paid over \r  to the owner of the animal. If the owner of the animal cannot be found, the \r  proceeds remaining shall be paid into the Literary Fund.</p>\r  \r   <p>M. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the \r  humane destruction of a critically injured or ill animal for humane purposes by \r  the impounding humane investigator, law-enforcement officer, animal control \r  officer, or licensed veterinarian.</p>\r  \r   <p>§ <a href=\"https://vacode.org/3.2-6570\">3.2-6570</a>.

This section shall not prohibit authorized wildlife \r  management activities or hunting, fishing or trapping as regulated under other \r  titles of the Code of Virginia, including Title 29.1, or to farming activities \r  as provided under this title or regulations adopted hereunder.</p>\r  \r   <p>E. It is unlawful for any person to kill a domestic dog or cat \r  for the purpose of obtaining the hide, fur or pelt of the dog or cat. A \r  violation of this subsection is a Class 1 misdemeanor.

Seizure and impoundment of animals; notice and\r hearing; disposition of animal; disposition of proceeds upon sale.</p>\r \r <p>A. Any humane investigator, law-enforcement officer or animal\r control officer may lawfully seize and impound any animal that has been\r abandoned, has been cruelly treated, or is suffering from an apparent violation\r of this chapter that has rendered the animal in such a condition as to\r constitute a direct and immediate threat to its life, safety or health. The\r seizure or impoundment of an equine resulting from a violation of clause<s>\r (iii)</s><ins> (iv)</ins> of subsection A or clause (ii) of subsection B of §\r <a href=\"https://vacode.org/3.2-6570\">3.2-6570</a> may be undertaken only by the State Veterinarian or State\r Veterinarian\'s representative who has received training in the examination and\r detection of sore horses as required by 9 C.F.R. Part 11.7.</p>\r \r <p>B. Before seizing or impounding any agricultural animal, the\r humane investigator, law-enforcement officer or animal control officer shall\r contact the State Veterinarian or State Veterinarian\'s representative, who\r shall recommend to the person the most appropriate action for effecting the\r seizure and impoundment. The humane investigator, law-enforcement officer or\r animal control officer shall notify the owner of the agricultural animal and\r the local attorney for the Commonwealth of the recommendation. The humane\r investigator, law-enforcement officer or animal control officer may impound the\r agricultural animal on the land where the agricultural animal is located if:</p>\r \r <p>1. The owner or tenant of the land where the agricultural\r animal is located gives written permission;</p>\r \r <p>2. A general district court so orders; or</p>\r \r <p>3. The owner or tenant of the land where the agricultural\r animal is located cannot be immediately located, and it is in the best interest\r of the agricultural animal to be impounded on the land where it is located\r until the written permission of the owner or tenant of the land can be\r obtained.</p>\r \r <p>If there is a direct and immediate threat to an agricultural\r animal, the humane investigator, law-enforcement officer or animal control\r officer may seize the animal, in which case the humane investigator,\r law-enforcement officer or animal control officer shall file within five\r business days on a form approved by the State Veterinarian a report on the\r condition of the animal at the time of the seizure, the location of\r impoundment, and any other information required by the State Veterinarian.</p>\r \r <p>C. Upon seizing or impounding an animal, the humane\r investigator, law-enforcement officer or animal control officer shall petition\r the general district court in the city or county where the animal is seized for\r a hearing. The hearing shall be not more than 10 business days from the date of\r the seizure of the animal. The hearing shall be to determine whether the animal\r has been abandoned, has been cruelly treated, or has not been provided adequate\r care.</p>\r \r <p>D. The humane investigator, law-enforcement officer, or animal\r control officer shall cause to be served upon the person with a right of\r property in the animal or the custodian of the animal notice of the hearing. If\r such person or the custodian is known and residing within the jurisdiction\r wherein the animal is seized, written notice shall be given at least five days\r prior to the hearing of the time and place of the hearing. If such person or\r the custodian is known but residing out of the jurisdiction where such animal\r is seized, written notice by any method or service of process as is provided by\r the Code of Virginia shall be given. If such person or the custodian is not\r known, the humane investigator, law-enforcement officer, or animal control\r officer shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in\r the jurisdiction wherein such animal is seized notice of the hearing at least\r one time prior to the hearing and shall further cause notice of the hearing to\r be posted at least five days prior to the hearing at the place provided for\r public notices at the city hall or courthouse wherein such hearing shall be\r held.</p>\r \r <p>E. The procedure for appeal and trial shall be the same as\r provided by law for misdemeanors. Trial by jury shall be as provided in Article\r 4 (§ <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-260\">19.2-260</a> et seq.) of Chapter 15 of Title 19.2. The Commonwealth shall be\r required to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\r \r <p>F. The humane investigator, law-enforcement officer, or animal\r control officer shall provide for such animal until the court has concluded the\r hearing. Any locality may require the owner of any animal held pursuant to this\r subsection for more than<s> thirty</s><ins> 30</ins> days to post a bond in surety\r with the locality for the amount of the cost of boarding the animal for a\r period of time set by ordinance, not to exceed nine months.</p>\r \r <p>In any locality that has not adopted such an ordinance, a\r court may order the owner of an animal held pursuant to this subsection for\r more than 30 days to post a bond in surety with the locality for the amount of\r the cost of boarding the animal for a period of time not to exceed nine months.\r The bond shall not be forfeited if the owner is found to be not guilty of the\r violation.</p>\r \r <p>If the court determines that the animal has been neither\r abandoned, cruelly treated, nor deprived of adequate care, the animal shall be\r returned to the owner. If the court determines that the animal has been (i)\r abandoned or cruelly treated, (ii) deprived of adequate care, as that term is\r defined in § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/3.2-6500\">3.2-6500</a>, or (iii) raised as a dog that has been, is, or is\r intended to be used in dogfighting in violation of § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/3.2-6571\">3.2-6571</a>, then the court\r shall order that the animal may be: (a) sold by a local governing body, if not\r a companion animal; (b) disposed of by a local governing body pursuant to\r subsection D of § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/3.2-6546\">3.2-6546</a>, whether such animal is a companion animal or an\r agricultural animal; or (c) delivered to the person with a right of property in\r the animal as provided in subsection G.</p>\r \r <p>G. In no case shall the owner be allowed to purchase, adopt,\r or otherwise obtain the animal if the court determines that the animal has been\r abandoned, cruelly treated, or deprived of adequate care. The court shall\r direct that the animal be delivered to the person with a right of property in\r the animal, upon his request, if the court finds that the abandonment, cruel\r treatment, or deprivation of adequate care is not attributable to the actions\r or inactions of such person.</p>\r \r <p>H. The court shall order the owner of any animal determined to\r have been abandoned, cruelly treated, or deprived of adequate care to pay all\r reasonable expenses incurred in caring and providing for such animal from the\r time the animal is seized until such time that the animal is disposed of in\r accordance with the provisions of this section, to the provider of such care.</p>\r \r <p>I. The court may prohibit the possession or ownership of other\r companion animals by the owner of any companion animal found to have been\r abandoned, cruelly treated, or deprived of adequate care. In making a\r determination to prohibit the possession or ownership of companion animals, the\r court may take into consideration the owner\'s past record of convictions under\r this chapter or other laws prohibiting cruelty to animals or pertaining to the\r care or treatment of animals and the owner\'s mental and physical condition.</p>\r \r <p>J. If the court finds that an agricultural animal has been\r abandoned or cruelly treated, the court may prohibit the possession or ownership\r of any other agricultural animal by the owner of the agricultural animal if the\r owner has exhibited a pattern of abandoning or cruelly treating agricultural\r animals as evidenced by previous convictions of violating § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/3.2-6504\">3.2-6504</a> or\r <a href=\"https://vacode.org/3.2-6570\">3.2-6570</a>. In making a determination to prohibit the possession or ownership of\r agricultural animals, the court may take into consideration the owner\'s mental\r and physical condition.</p>\r \r <p>K. Any person who is prohibited from owning or possessing\r animals pursuant to subsection I or J may petition the court to repeal the\r prohibition after two years have elapsed from the date of entry of the court\'s\r order. The court may, in its discretion, repeal the prohibition if the person\r can prove to the satisfaction of the court that the cause for the prohibition\r has ceased to exist.</p>\r \r <p>L. When a sale occurs, the proceeds shall first be applied to\r the costs of the sale then next to the unreimbursed expenses for the care and\r provision of the animal, and the remaining proceeds, if any, shall be paid over\r to the owner of the animal. If the owner of the animal cannot be found, the\r proceeds remaining shall be paid into the Literary Fund.</p>\r \r <p>M.

May classify hospitals and nursing homes by type of \r  specialty or service and may provide for licensing hospitals and nursing homes \r  by bed capacity and by type of specialty or service;</p>\r  \r   <p>4. Shall also require that each hospital establish a protocol \r  for organ donation, in compliance with federal law and the regulations of the \r  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), particularly 42 C.F.R. § \r  482.45. Each hospital shall have an agreement with an organ procurement \r  organization designated in CMS regulations for routine contact, whereby the \r  provider\'s designated organ procurement organization certified by CMS (i) is \r  notified in a timely manner of all deaths or imminent deaths of patients in the \r  hospital and (ii) is authorized to determine the suitability of the decedent or \r  patient for organ donation and, in the absence of a similar arrangement with \r  any eye bank or tissue bank in Virginia certified by the Eye Bank Association \r  of America or the American Association of Tissue Banks, the suitability for \r  tissue and eye donation.

The intake officer \r  or clerk with whom the petition or motion is filed shall inquire whether the \r  petitioner is receiving child support services or public assistance. No \r  individual who is receiving support services or public assistance shall be \r  denied the right to file a petition or motion to establish, modify, or enforce \r  an order for support of a child.

The appearance of a child before an intake officer may be \r  by (i) personal appearance before the intake officer or (ii) use of two-way \r  electronic video and audio communication. If two-way electronic video and audio \r  communication is used, an intake officer may exercise all powers conferred by \r  law. All communications and proceedings shall be conducted in the same manner \r  as if the appearance were in person, and any documents filed may be transmitted \r  by facsimile process. The facsimile may be served or executed by the officer or \r  person to whom sent, and returned in the same manner, and with the same force, \r  effect, authority, and liability as an original document. All signatures \r  thereon shall be treated as original signatures.

A petition alleging that a juvenile \r  committed a violent juvenile felony shall be filed with the court. A petition \r  alleging that a juvenile is delinquent for an offense that would be a felony if \r  committed by an adult shall be filed with the court if the juvenile had \r  previously been proceeded against informally by intake or had been adjudicated \r  delinquent for an offense that would be a felony if committed by an adult.</p>\r  \r   <p>If a juvenile is alleged to be a truant pursuant to a complaint \r  filed in accordance with § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/22.1-258\">22.1-258</a> and the attendance officer has provided \r  documentation to the intake officer that the relevant school division has \r  complied with the provisions of § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/22.1-258\">22.1-258</a>, then the intake officer shall file \r  a petition with the court. The intake officer may defer filing the complaint \r  for 90 days and proceed informally by developing a truancy plan, provided that<s> (a)</s><ins> (1)</ins> \r  the juvenile has not previously been proceeded against informally or \r  adjudicated in need of supervision on more than two occasions for failure to \r  comply with compulsory school attendance as provided in § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/22.1-254\">22.1-254</a> and<s> (b)</s><ins> (2)</ins> \r  the immediately previous informal action or adjudication occurred at least \r  three calendar years prior to the current complaint. The juvenile and his \r  parent or parents, guardian, or other person standing in loco parentis must \r  agree, in writing, for the development of a truancy plan. The truancy plan may \r  include requirements that the juvenile and his parent or parents, guardian, or \r  other person standing in loco parentis participate in such programs, cooperate \r  in such treatment, or be subject to such conditions and limitations as \r  necessary to ensure the juvenile\'s compliance with compulsory school attendance \r  as provided in § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/22.1-254\">22.1-254</a>. The intake officer may refer the juvenile to the \r  appropriate public agency for the purpose of developing a truancy plan using an \r  interagency interdisciplinary team approach. The team may include qualified \r  personnel who are reasonably available from the appropriate department of \r  social services, community services board, local school division, court service \r  unit, and other appropriate and available public and private agencies and may \r  be the family assessment and planning team established pursuant to § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/2.2-5207\">2.2-5207</a>. \r  If at the end of the 90-day period the juvenile has not successfully completed \r  the truancy plan or the truancy program, then the intake officer shall file the \r  petition.</p>\r  \r   <p>Whenever informal action is taken as provided in this \r  subsection on a complaint alleging that a child is in need of services, in need \r  of supervision, or delinquent, the intake officer shall<s> (1)</s><ins> (A)</ins> develop a plan for the \r  juvenile, which may include restitution and the performance of community \r  service, based upon community resources and the circumstances which resulted in \r  the complaint,<s> (2)</s><ins> (B)</ins> \r  create an official record of the action taken by the intake officer and file \r  such record in the juvenile\'s case file, and<s> (3)</s><ins> (C)</ins> advise the juvenile and \r  the juvenile\'s parent, guardian, or other person standing in loco parentis and \r  the complainant that any subsequent complaint alleging that the child is in \r  need of supervision or delinquent based upon facts which may be sufficient to \r  invoke the jurisdiction of the court pursuant to § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-241\">16.1-241</a> will result in the \r  filing of a petition with the court.</p>\r  \r   <p>C. The intake officer shall accept and file a petition in \r  which it is alleged that (i) the custody, visitation, or support of a child is the \r  subject of controversy or requires determination, (ii) a person has deserted, \r  abandoned, or failed to provide support for any person in violation of law, \r  (iii) a child or such child\'s parent, guardian, legal custodian, or other \r  person standing in loco parentis is entitled to treatment, rehabilitation, or \r  other services which are required by law, (iv) family abuse has occurred and a \r  protective order is being sought pursuant to § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-253.1\">16.1-253.1</a>, <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-253.4\">16.1-253.4</a>, or \r  <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-279.1\">16.1-279.1</a>, or (v) an act of violence, force, or threat has occurred, a \r  protective order is being sought pursuant to § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-152.8\">19.2-152.8</a>, <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-152.9\">19.2-152.9</a>, or \r  <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-152.10\">19.2-152.10</a>, and either the alleged victim or the respondent is a juvenile. If \r  any such complainant does not file a petition, the intake officer may file it. \r  In cases in which a child is alleged to be abused, neglected, in need of \r  services, in need of supervision, or delinquent, if the intake officer believes \r  that probable cause does not exist, or that the authorization of a petition \r  will not be in the best interest of the family or juvenile or that the matter \r  may be effectively dealt with by some agency other than the court, he may \r  refuse to authorize the filing of a petition. The intake officer shall provide \r  to a person seeking a protective order pursuant to § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-253.1\">16.1-253.1</a>, <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-253.4\">16.1-253.4</a>, or \r  <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-279.1\">16.1-279.1</a> a written explanation of the conditions, procedures and time limits \r  applicable to the issuance of protective orders pursuant to § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-253.1\">16.1-253.1</a>, \r  <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-253.4\">16.1-253.4</a>, or <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-279.1\">16.1-279.1</a>. If the person is seeking a protective order pursuant \r  to § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-152.8\">19.2-152.8</a>, <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-152.9\">19.2-152.9</a>, or <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-152.10\">19.2-152.10</a>, the intake officer shall provide a \r  written explanation of the conditions, procedures, and time limits applicable \r  to the issuance of protective orders pursuant to § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-152.8\">19.2-152.8</a>, <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-152.9\">19.2-152.9</a>, or \r  <a href=\"https://vacode.org/19.2-152.10\">19.2-152.10</a>.</p>\r  \r   <p>D. Prior to the filing of any petition alleging that a child \r  is in need of supervision, the matter shall be reviewed by an intake officer \r  who shall determine whether the petitioner and the child alleged to be in need \r  of supervision have utilized or attempted to utilize treatment and services \r  available in the community and have exhausted all appropriate nonjudicial \r  remedies which are available to them. When the intake officer determines that \r  the parties have not attempted to utilize available treatment or services or \r  have not exhausted all appropriate nonjudicial remedies which are available, he \r  shall refer the petitioner and the child alleged to be in need of supervision \r  to the appropriate agency, treatment facility, or individual to receive \r  treatment or services, and a petition shall not be filed. Only after the intake \r  officer determines that the parties have made a reasonable effort to utilize \r  available community treatment or services may he permit the petition to be \r  filed.</p>\r  \r   <p>E. If the intake officer refuses to authorize a petition \r  relating to an offense that if committed by an adult would be punishable as a \r  Class 1 misdemeanor or as a felony, the complainant shall be notified in \r  writing at that time of the complainant\'s right to apply to a magistrate for a \r  warrant. If a magistrate determines that probable cause exists, he shall issue \r  a warrant returnable to the juvenile and domestic relations district court. The \r  warrant shall be delivered forthwith to the juvenile court, and the intake \r  officer shall accept and file a petition founded upon the warrant. If the court \r  is closed and the magistrate finds that the criteria for detention or shelter \r  care set forth in § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-248.1\">16.1-248.1</a> have been satisfied, the juvenile may be \r  detained pursuant to the warrant issued in accordance with this subsection. If \r  the intake officer refuses to authorize a petition relating to a child in need \r  of services or in need of supervision, a status offense, or a misdemeanor other \r  than Class 1, his decision is final.</p>\r  \r   <p>Upon delivery to the juvenile court of a warrant issued \r  pursuant to subdivision 2 of § <a href=\"https://vacode.org/16.1-256\">16.1-256</a>, the intake officer shall accept and \r  file a petition founded upon the warrant.</p>\r  \r   <p>F.

According to the Virginia Department of Planning and Budget’s analysis of DSS\'s proposed increased training requirements earlier this year, the “proposed changes are not driven by identified deficiencies that might affect the health or safety of children in care” and “the costs of these changes likely far outweigh the convenience of having one standard for all licensees.”  What is worse, by discouraging parental participation in the classroom, DSS\'s proposed rules could actually make preschools less safe -- because what could be better for children\'s safety than parents seeing firsthand what is happening in their child\'s classroom?\n\nAs a concerned mom, citizen, and voter, I will be tracking with great interest the legislators who do and do not support this bipartisan, common-sense bill.\n\n\n','comment','published','n','2019-01-18 10:30:32','2019-01-18 15:30:32'),(12950,81022,45618,'Jackie','example@example.com',NULL,'127.225.9.11','My son has attended Annandale Cooperative Preschool for 3 years and I will have a second child entering next year.

These benefits appear in several forms: as trained professionals/teachers; as PTA presidents/leaders; or as reliable volunteers in the classroom or coaches on the fields and courts.  \nI know of at least 25 co-oping parents who returned to school to get their degree in teaching.  Many of these parents had not studied education when in college, but as a result of their experience in their children’s classrooms, they discovered the joy of teaching and so spent the next 3-5 years enrolled in a local university (while raising their own children!) working toward their teaching certification.  Many of these parents are currently teaching throughout Northern Virginia area schools.  \nCurrently, in the Arlington County Public Schools, five of the current PTA Presidents are former co-op preschool parents who have committed their time and talents in sharing their knowledge with their children’s school communities.  There are other co-op families who participate in the PTA at their children’s school attending meetings and volunteering to lead special events.  The impact of these families extends beyond the school.  In Arlington, several Coaches and Assistant Coaches began as cooping parents.  The experience of co-oping provided these parents with the confidence and the skills to comfortably handle a group of children. \nElementary School Teachers respect the experiences of parents whose children attended cooperative preschools.  I learned quickly to share with my daughter’s teacher that we had attended a coop preschool because as a volunteer I was then invited to assist in the elementary school classroom working with the children.  \nCo-oping parents learn through the “on the job training” provided in a cooperative preschool setting.  This “on the job training” continues to benefit many children even beyond the preschool years.

As the parent of a child currently studying in a co-op preschool, I’ve seen first hand the benefits to both students and parents from the co-op model.  Co-oping isn’t just about saving money for parents, though for some being able to reduce costs by participating as a co-op parent is the only reason their children are able to attend preschool.  Co-oping also provides a unique window into the classroom for parents to see how their children learn and grow, and also to better form social networks among both children and parents. \n\nHB2258 will simply maintain the current training requirement for co-op parents volunteering in their own child\'s class under the guidance and supervision of professional teachers.  These existing rules have been in place for decades with absolutely no evidence of harm that might require changes.  At best, proposals for new regulations are a solution in search of a problem that doesn’t exist. \n\nWithout HB2258, new regulations will raise training requirements to a level that will decrease parent involvement, increase costs, and bar the meaningful parental involvement essential to maintaining parent cooperatives.  Those regulations would effectively end co-op preschools as we know them today, and for no benefit to Virginia students or parents. \n\nAs a Virginia constituent, I hope you will be part of the bipartisan consensus, including six House co-patrons and four Senate co-patrons, that supports HB2258. \n\nThank you for your leadership on this important issue.','comment','published','n','2019-02-10 13:26:07','2019-02-10 18:26:07'),(13276,81637,45618,'Wayland','example@example.com',NULL,'127.23.146.245','HB2258 was passed unanimously in its House subcommittee (6-Y 0-N), committee (22-Y 0-N) and on the House Floor (99-Y 0-N).\n\nHB 2258 ensures that parents\' training requirements for cooperative preschools remain unchanged and manageable.
