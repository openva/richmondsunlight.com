		<h2>Vote CSV</h2>
		<p>Each legislator’s voting record is available, by year, as a CSV file. (No XML yet.)
		That’s found by appending <code>votes/yyyy.csv/</code> to the legislator’s page
		on Richmond Sunlight. For instance, <a href="/legislator/psticer/">Sen. Patsy Ticer’s</a>
		CSV voting data for 2008 is found at
		<code><a href="/legislator/psticer/votes/2008/csv/">https://www.richmondsunlight.com/legislator/psticer/votes/2008.csv</a></code>.
		Legislator voting CSV data provides the following, for which sample data for Sen. Ticer is
		included parenthetically:</p>

		<ul class="classic">
			<li>bill number (SB115)</li>
			<li>bill title (Traffic lights; creates Class 1 misdemeanor for running red light.)</li>
			<li>vote (Y)</li>
			<li>outcome (pass)</li>
			<li>committee (Transportation)</li>
			<li>date (2008-01-10)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>This data is updated nightly, at 2:15am. The legislature, in turn, provides Richmond
		Sunlight with voting data at 2:00am each day; we’re not holding out on you.</p>

		<h2>Bulk Downloads</h2>
		<p>An increasingly large amount of data is being provided at
		<a href="https://www.richmondsunlight.com/downloads/">https://www.richmondsunlight.com/downloads/</a>.
		This is simply a directory with files that we hope sport self-evident names. Right now you
		can download CSV files of all bills and legislators for the current session, or the full
		text of any bill (as HTML) of any bill from 2006–today. Bill text is also available on a
		per-year basis, zipped up as a single file for each year. This data is updated nightly, at
		3:00am.</p>
