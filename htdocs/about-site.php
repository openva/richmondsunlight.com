		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Richmond Sunlight is a non-partisan website that aggregates information about the General
		Assembly, the lawmaking body that governs the state of Virginia. It is an independent,
		volunteer-run website that is in no way affiliated with the Virginia General Assembly or the
		state government.</p>

		<h2>The Data</h2>
		<p>All data about bills—titles, numbers, patrons, text, status, etc.—comes from the <a
		href="http://leg1.state.va.us/">General Assembly's Legislative Information System</a>, which
		is the General Assembly's own service.  Some of the data comes in bulk from their <a
		href="http://lis.virginia.gov/SiteInformation/ftp.html">FTP CSV service</a>, which is
		provided for services just such as Richmond Sunlight.  Most legislative data is updated
		hourly, but bill histories (the bill's progress—votes and the like) are updated daily around
		2:30pm, because that is when the General Assembly makes that data available.</p>

		<p>The remainder of the data is gathered from a variety of resources. Fundraising data comes
		from <a href="http://www.vpap.org/">the Virginia Public Access Project</a>, election history
		data comes from <a href="http://www.sbe.state.va.us/">the State Board of Elections</a>, and
		the remainder comes from a variety of resources.</p>
