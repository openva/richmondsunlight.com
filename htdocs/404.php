    <p>We're sorry, the page you've attempted to load cannot be found.</p>

    <h2>Cause</h2>
    <p>If you've followed a link to Richmond Sunlight from another website, the
    link may just be wrong.  If you've followed a link from within our website,
    then <em>we</em> are wrong.  In either case, the fact that you've had this
    trouble has been noted, and we'll investigate how we can keep this from
    happening again.</p>

    <h2>Solutions</h2>
    <ul class="classic">
        <li><a href="/">Start back at the home page</a> and browse your way to the
        information that you're looking for.</li>
        <li><a href="/search/">Search</a> the site for the information.  The site's
        search system only finds bills, so if you're looking for something else then
        it probably won't do you much good.</li>
        <li><a href="/contact/">E-mail us and tell us the problem</a>. Please
        include the URL of the page you were trying to access, the URL of the
        page that provide you the inaccurate link, and any other information that
        you think might help us track down and solve the problem for you.</li>
