		<p>GENERAL INFORMATION<br />
		The TOS constitute the entire agreement between you and Richmond Sunlight and
		govern your use of the Service, superceding any prior agreements between you and
		Richmond Sunlight. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions
		that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content or
		third-party software. The TOS and the relationship between you and Richmond
		Sunlight shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia without
		regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Richmond Sunlight agree to
		submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within
		the city of Richmond, Virginia. The failure of Richmond Sunlight to exercise
		or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of
		such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of
		competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the
		court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in
		the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and
		effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any
		claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the
		TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose
		or be forever barred.</p>

		<p>The section titles in the TOS are for convenience only and have no legal or
		contractual effect.</p>
