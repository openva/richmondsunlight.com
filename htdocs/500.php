    # PAGE CONTENT
    $page_body = <<<EOD
		<p>An internal server error has prevented your request from being processed.</p>

		<h2>Cause</h2>
		<p>It's not your fault. It's ours. Honest.  Something minor is awry with the
		server, temporarily, and it's probably OK now.</p>

		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<p>In all likelihood, simply reloading this page will cause this error to go away,
		and the page that you wanted to appear. Sorry about the trouble!</p>
